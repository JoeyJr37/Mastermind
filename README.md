# Mastermind
 This is a project built for The Odin Project curriculum

 The rules of Mastermind:
 A secret code consisting of four (out of six possible) colors will be selected by the Code Maker. 

 The Code Breaker will then try and guess that secret code within 12 turns.
 After each guess, the Code Maker will provide feedback to the Code Breaker concerning whether or not the guesses made were correct in color & position, just color or not correct at all. 

 If after 12 turns the Code Breaker is not able to determine the secret code, the Code Maker wins the game.
